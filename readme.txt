Filter posts through multiple taxonomies

== Description ==

Say you have two custom taxnomies defined: genre and artist.

Currently, you can do the following types of queries on your site:

`?genre=jazz`

`?genre=jazz&cat=1`

But you can't do this:

`?genre=jazz&artist=chet-baker`

WordPress will just ignore one of the parameters. This plugin fixes that.

It also comes with a drill-down navigation widget.
